### Project Description
This project is a user-friendly website designed to assess and assist elderly individuals in managing their daily lives. It provides essential features such as health monitoring, medication reminders, emergency support, and social connectivity. The platform aims to enhance the well-being of seniors by offering easy-to-use tools for self-assessment, caregiver coordination, and access to essential services.

### The Problem statement
Many elderly people face challenges in managing their health, daily tasks, and staying connected with family and caregivers. They may forget medications, struggle with appointments, or feel isolated. Caregivers also find it difficult to track and assist them efficiently.

A simple, user-friendly elderly assessment website is needed to help seniors with health monitoring, reminders, emergency support, and social connection, making their lives safer and more independent.
